# Backend application

This directory contains the Spring Boot backend for the TQ Exchange Hub project.

## Getting started

```bash
cd backend
mvn spring-boot:run
```

The sample project exposes a `GET /api/health` endpoint that returns `{ "status": "UP" }` so you can confirm the service is running.
